		<p class="headingstyle"><b>The World Is Asking - What Is SPARTA Coaching?</b> <br></p>
		<p class="headingstyle">SPARTA Coaching is an
		extracurricular coaching service that matches youth ("Students") and
		young professionals ("Coaches") who share the same passion. Coaches
		have expertise in extracurricular activities that are typically
		offered by schools (e.g. Basketball, Acting, Trumpet) and those that
		are not (e.g. Robotics, Screenwriting, Tap Dance). Coaches provide
		individual instruction and incorporate social media tools to enhance
		the Students' extracurricular experiences. The SPARTA Coaching program
		emphasizes not only the improvement of the skills themselves, but also
		the process of creating goals, achieving goals, and promoting success.
		 <br></p>
		
		<p class="headingstyle">SPARTA Coaching is the first global brand of coaches exclusively for extracurriculars.<br><br></p>
		<p class="headingstyle"><b>Students Are Asking - What Is The Benefit Of SPARTA Coaching For Me?</b> <br></p>
		<p class="headingstyle">SPARTA Coaching allows you to do <b> what you want</b>, <b>with who you want</b>, <b>when
		you want</b>, <b> with no risk of failure or defeat</b>, and <b>share
		with your friends and family</b> (and maybe the world) how talented you
		are and the progress you have made.  <br>
		</p>
		
		<p class="headingstyle">SPARTA Coaching gives you flexibility to choose <b>any</b> interest outside of the classroom
		(in sports, arts, music, electronics, writing, cooking or other extracurricular activities), with a Coach of <b>your choice</b> (not
		your school), at times <b>most convenient for you</b> (in case you want to hangout with your friends), in
		a crafted goal oriented program that <b>emphasizes development not perfection</b> (so you can work at it stress-free), and uses a <b>private
		social media platform</b> for you to post updates of your success, connect with others who share your passion, and receive praise from your fans
		(because there will be many).  <br><br>
